# JS-Course-Project-1
The Goal of this project was to add functionality to a web page

The instructor provided the HTML/CSS and we had to implement JS functionality   
    -Used DOM manipulation on input boxes and buttons to output the desired outcome

User functionality:
    -The user is supposed to input a number and guess a number from 1-20
    -Computer checks and if number is not correct -1 point
    -Loop repeats till user guesses the right number
    -Highscore logged 
    -Again button to reset the game but keep the Highscore

Coding Process:
    -Game logic used: if statements to determine if the number guessed was > or < 20.
    -DOM manipulation used to log user's guess and display if guess was too low or too high
    -Once right number was guessed, used dom manipulation to display green background and show number in the center
    -Learning how to use functions to cleanup duplicate code EX: 
         document.querySelector('.message').textContent = message; 
         can be converted to:

        const displayMessage = function (message) {
        document.querySelector('.message').textContent = message;
        }; 

        and be reused as...
        
        displayMessage('...instert message here')
